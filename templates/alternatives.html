       Other pain relievers may also work to help alleviate your symptoms. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory agents such as ibuprofen or naproxen, and prescription topicals like diclofenac may help acute soft tissue injuries or chronic joint-related conditions if used regularly. Topical lidocaine may help mitigate symptoms of neuropathy. Other pain-relieving gels include Biofreeze and Tiger Balm.</p>
